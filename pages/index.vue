                    Since the beginning my journey as a software developer
                    {{ $dayjs().year() - 2017 }} years ago, I've done office and remote work for companies, and
                    collaborated with teams of developers to build and maintain awesome products. I'm quietly confident,
                    naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my craft.
