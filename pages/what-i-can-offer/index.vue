                <p class="mb-3 indent-md">
                    A Web app is an online software. That is accessible from browsers such as Google, Safari, Firefox,
                    etc. This means it is available everywhere there is internet connection.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3 indent-md">
                    Web appsâ€™ ancestor was a 2000s software sold on CD and installed on PC data storage. This is an
                    obsolete technology; nowadays the device is no longer a limit.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3 indent-md">
                    If developed to adapt to operating systems such as Android and iOS, the web app is available also on
                    smartphones and tablets through the associated mobile app. Whatsapp, for example, was born as a
                    mobile app but then a browser web app was integrated to it.
