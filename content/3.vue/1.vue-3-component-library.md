This are component libraries that support vue 3 that you can use on your vue 3 projects. Lets just start and no further ado. This list is not in order on whos best. Beta or alpha version are not included. If you have more suggestions comment it bellow.

## [1. Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/en-US/dark)

Well according to the website it is a fairly complete, Theme Customizable, Uses TypeScript, Fast and Kinda interesting. I tried this component library my self and it has a lot of useful components. I also like how you can customize the themes.

## [5. Quasar](https://quasar.dev/)

Quasar is the might be one of my favorite because it has most of the components that I need to build a website or desktop applications.

## [6. Varlet](https://varlet.gitee.io/varlet-ui/#/en-US/)

This library is also good but it mostly focusses on mobile components, so if your building a mobile or desktop, this library is great. It can still be used for web.

## [7. Vant 3](https://vant-contrib.gitee.io/vant/#/en-US/notice-bar)

## [8. Prime Vue](https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/)

What I like about this component library it has different css styles to choose from like material, bootstrap, etc. And also has most useful library to create a website or apps but you have to install other libraries to use other components.
