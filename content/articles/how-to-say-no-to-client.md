When we are working with a client, sometimes clients can ask a lot of questions that if we answered it incorrectly we can suffer from it.

So here are some question you might encounter in your gigs or career, as a full timer or a freelancer, and how to say "Hell No" without losing a gig.

### 1. Can we see a pass before we hire you?
```
I need a deposit to reserve my time
and pay for my assets needed to knock
this out of the park for you.
```

### 2. Can you do this for less?
```
If budget is our priority,
lets start with the amount
you have in mind and
back into a deliverable
that makes sense for
that number
```

### 3. Can you do this for free/your portfolio?
```
The results of this
campaign (done properly)
will more than pay back
this initial
investment
```

### 4. Can we add this quick little deliverable?
```
Absolutely, i'll just
tack the extra hours
on to your final invoice,
does that work? 
```

### 5. Can we get unlimited revisions?
```
Sure! My quote includes
2 rounds revisions.
After those, you can have
as many as you'd like,
we'll just switch to
hourly billing.
```
