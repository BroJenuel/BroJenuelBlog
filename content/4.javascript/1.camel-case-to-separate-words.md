So you might also have encountered this problem were you want to transpose a camelcased words into space separated words, well here it is.

Let me explain that way you understand what is happening here.

We used the `.replace(arg1, arg2)`. The first argument is what were going to find. The second argument will replace what we found.

We used a regex `/([a-z0-9])([A-Z])/g`. This means where going to find 2 group, `()` means a capture group. As you can see we have 2 group `([a-z0-9])` and `([A-Z])`. So this means it will look small/numbers and capital that is together like `aB` or `6B`.

Next we have this `"$1 $2"`. so we explained a while ago about the regex capture groups. So `$1` will represent the group 1, and `$2` represents the group 2. So for example `aB` it will be `a B`, beause our second argument which is `"$1 $2"` has space between. Another example:

```js
`yourTheBest`.replace(/([a-z0-9])([A-Z])/g, "$1-$2");
// output: 'your-The-Best'
```

This is because our separator is dashed between "$1-$2". So if we like to add more groups we can add `$3` to represent the 3rd group. example:

```js
`yourTheB1est`.replace(/([a-z0-9])([A-Z])([0-9])/g, "$1-$2 $3");

// output: 'yourThe-B 1est'
```

So in the above code we added another group which is `([0-9])` and it will find 0 to 9 character. So if it will find this characters together in order based on the group it will replace based on the format we types which is `"$1-$2 $3"` so it becomes `'yourThe-B 1est'`. It ignored the `yourThe` because it has no number after the `T`.
